# Learning-Through-Video-With-MCQ
This is a webapp I created that helps children in South Africa learn through high quality videos, question quizzes and matched workbook activities.  For various subjects and grades.

Features:
- The app has video lessons, quiz questions and textbook linked activities that match the content and order of learning aligned with the official South African School CAPS curriculum. 
- User/students watch videos that are high quality, one video at a time, that is linked to a question or activity that must be completed to move onto the next video/lesson.
- The videos are sourced from YouTube and are of a high quality with entertainment, education and curriculum alignment being the focus.
- There are multiple choice questions which must be answered to move onto the next video, this proves that students where learning from the video or that they are ready for the next lesson.
- There are activities that link to the physical textbooks of students that must also be completed to move forward to new lessons.
- There are artistic backgrounds and animations as part of the User Interface to further increase entertainment and quality.
- There are animations that play when students answer correctly.
- There are differently themed animations and art styles based on subject.

Important to Note for developer only:
All videos removed and stored locally, see the below folders for some examples. Remmeber type .mp4 in local folder to see all the videos backed up and there locations. 

See local folder for videos not on Giihub repo but forms part of the code and should be placed back into there locations if this app is ever hosted online officially.
