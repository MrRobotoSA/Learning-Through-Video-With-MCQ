<h1>Summary</h1>
<h3>
    - A species is a category with in the classification system. Living things of the same type belong to the same species.
</h3> 
<h3>
    - Just as there are many different dog Species, there are also different human races
</h3>
<h3>
    - According to the scientific definition of a species, all humans belong to the same species, Since any two people from  different races can reproduce and have fertile children.
</h3>
<h3>
    - Variation is a term used for the differences between individuals of the same species
</h3>
<h2>Why do we look the way we do? </h2>
<h3>Everything you are, you have inherited from your mother and father.<br>
    Inheritance is the transfer of parents characteristics to their children.<br>
    Inheritance means that all living organisms will have offspring that are particular to their species. <br>
    Inheritance is responsible for children looking like their parents, and for other family members looking alike.
</h3>

    1)true or false... <br>
    2)true or false... <br>
    3)true or false and so on....</h2>
<h1>questions</h1>
<h3>1) A group of living organisms that can cross-breed with each other (produce offspring) and of which the young are fertile, is called a species.</h3>
<h3>2) A species is a group of people that is grouped together on the grounds of different skin colours amongst other things</h3>
<h3>3) A variation is the differences between individuals of the same genus</h3>
<h3>4) Dachshunds and wolfdogs are the same species</h3>
<h3>5) Horses and Donkeys can not reproduce</h3>
<h3>6) Homo Sapien is the genus and species name of humans</h3>
<h3>7) To be fertile means an organism can not reproduce</h3>
<h3>8) You inherit your genetic traits only from your father</h3>
<h3>9) Different dogs can breed with each other because they are all the same species</h3>
<h3>10) A genetic trait, like your hair colour, is inherited from your mother and father</h3>
